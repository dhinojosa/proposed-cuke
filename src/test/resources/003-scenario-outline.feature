Feature: Discount calculation

    Scenario Outline: Apply discount to total
        Given a subtotal of <subtotal>
        When I apply a discount of <discountPercent> percent
        Then the final total should be <total>

        Examples:
            | subtotal | discountPercent | total |
            | 100.00   | 10              | 90.00 |
            | 80.00    | 25              | 60.00 |
            | 50.00    | 0               | 50.00 |
